## Bike Sharing and ACS Income Datasets

The bike sharing dataset (hour.csv) is from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset.

The ACS Income dataset (preprocessed_income_2018.csv) is obtained by running the preprocessing code from https://github.com/yujinj/OOD-generalization/blob/main/preprocess-data.ipynb.

This directory contains the scripts used for the application studies (bike.py, income.py), along with the corresponding cached results (.pkl) and generated figures (.png).
